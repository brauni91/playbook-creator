This Pyton script checks the coding style of the Playbook Creator source files.
Every source file that has changed since the last build, is given to the
"cpplint.py" script, which checks Google's code conventions. To detect that a 
file has changed, this script will calculate an md5 hash of the source file
and compare it to a previous hash from the last build that is stored in "hashRegister.txt"
